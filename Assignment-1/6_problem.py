#Write a Python program to check if a given number
# is a perfect number. 
# A Perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the
#  sum of its proper divisors. For instance, 6 has divisors 1, 2,
#  and 3, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so 6 is a perfect number.
#      Input: 5 
#      Output: No 

num = int(input("Enter a number:"))
sum_of_divisors = 0
for i in range(1, num):
    if num % i ==0:
        sum_of_divisors += i

if sum_of_divisors == num:
        print("yes, it's a perfect number.")
else:
        print("No, it's not a perfect number.")
